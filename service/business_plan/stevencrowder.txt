### **4. Red Flags & Issues**

ðŸš© **Unrealistic Budget Allocation** â€“ Asking for **$50,000 for a studio** setup is excessive when high-quality content can be produced with much less.

ðŸš© **Overestimation of Growth Potential** â€“ The claim that revenue will jump from **$5,000 to $20,000/month in one year** is **not backed by a realistic strategy**.

ðŸš© **Risky Expenses** â€“ Funds allocated to **luxury networking events and PR consulting** are not essential for revenue growth.

ðŸš© **High Debt Burden** â€“ A repayment plan of **$4,200/month** is nearly **85% of current income**, making default highly likely.

ðŸš© **Lack of Existing Financial Stability** â€“ Monthly revenue is **too low to justify a $150,000 loan**.
